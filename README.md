### Prerequisites

Because 'pyct' this software run under python 2.7;

List of packeges to run Rcurvelet_Features: skimage, sklearn, pandas, numpy, sys, scipy and pyct.

Only 'pyct' don't install by pip install, easy install or anaconda repo. 

To install pyct use the repository: https://github.com/slimgroup/PyCurvelab

## Running the examples

### Features Generator: 

To make a train features type:

$ python RCurvelet_Features.py path/to/input_image.jpg path/to/output_file.csv

To make a test features:

$ python RCurvelet_Features.py path/to/input_image.jpg path/to/output_file.csv image_class image_survey_score

### Score Q Generator:

Watch out for models in models folder.

This module uses trained models. 
The models were trained with classes jpge, jp2k, Gaussian white noise and Gaussin Blur of data sets Live IQA, TID2013 and CSIQ.

The name of the models follows a fixed structure: 
a) Regressor models name is: regressor_class_DEGRADATION_model.pkl
b) Scale models name is: scale_class_DEGRADATION_model.pkl

To make a score:

$ python RCurvelet_Score.py input.csv #To show

$ python RCurvelet_Score.py input.csv score.csv #To save output file.

Note: input.csv can be a multiline file.


### Model Generator:

Will appear soon

### Usefull script for batch of images

Use a shell script "usefull_script.sh" to make a scores for a batch of images.
